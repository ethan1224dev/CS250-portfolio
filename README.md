How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by first understanding the main goal the user wants to achieve, then breaking that goal into smaller, actionable tasks. Writing user stories helps me focus on the “why” behind each feature. This keeps development centered on user value instead of just technical requirements. For example, user stories like “As a traveler, I want to view package options easily so I can make a quick decision” make it clear what functionality matters most.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach development through small, testable iterations that provide working results early. Agile processes such as sprint planning and retrospectives help keep progress visible and adaptable. Going forward, I plan to keep using short sprint cycles, continuous feedback, and version control with regular code reviews to improve collaboration and reduce rework.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating openly, respecting different perspectives, and supporting the team’s goals over individual preferences. In Agile, teamwork depends on transparency; sharing progress and helping others when needed. A strong team member not only completes their tasks but also contributes to keeping the entire sprint on track.
